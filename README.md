To run this web application:
  ```
  1. Download the latest version
  2. Unzip the folder
  3. Click on index.html
  4. The GraphHopper router will by default use GraphHopper’s public servers. You need to register and get an API key to use these, and you need to give that API key to the router instance.

If you set up your own GraphHopper server, you don’t need the API key, but instead configure the address of your server.
